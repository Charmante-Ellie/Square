#  Choosing The Square life 

![alt text](https://images.app.goo.gl/66UbYG1CbaYwKjSL9.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")


### * Company name : Square 

### * The company was formed in February 2009 in St Louis, Missouri. 

### * The founders are Jack Dorsey, Jim McKelvey and Tristan O'Tierney. 



#### How it all started:

* The Idea for the company was launched when Jack Dorsey friend Jim Mckelvey was unable to accept a 2000 $ credit card  payment  for one of his glass faucets and fittings. That’s when the Idea for Square started to brew. “Jim McKelvey (co-founder of Square) was in an art fair and couldn’t sell a piece of glass because he couldn’t accept a credit card; so that was $2,000 lost.”
 – Jack Dorsey  stated. 


#### Company fundings and investors:

* Although,the amount of money that  was invested into this company wasn’t divulged we can say that it was a pretty hefty sum. One of the founders already held alot weight to his name. Jack Dorsey was already attached to a successful global social media platform called Twitter. M.dorsey swaeyed inverstor in an unconventional manner. Instead of saying all the reasons why this company would be a huge success he underlined why it would plummet  or better yet stated and I quote “140 reasons why Square will fail”. This pitch was thoroughly thought out to the point where major players in the tech world and a credit card provider  were in awe. Apple and Visa had no problem consigning this new adventure to help water these entrepreneurs' amazing idea. 



### Business Activities:

* Square is a mobile payment processor company, it  was created to help merchants that are established , beginning or even seasonal. Square facilitates the process of accepting payments with ease by using one of their portable adapters. Square main competitor would be paypal. 

### What makes Square the better choice? 

Square has an offline feature which allows clerks to accept payments even if they might not be connected to a service provider,not to worry  as soon as the merchant has connection  to a service provider the payment will be automatically processed. Square limits the amount of fees they charge to their customers. However Paypal has 3 service fees that Square doesn’t: non-US card fee which is an additional 1.5%,  a currency conversion fee and  a chargeback fee of 20$  if applied.

### Landscape: 

Square is a part of merchant payment service. 
Square was created to help business owners that are established,beginning or even seasonal to process payments. Square acceptes payments with ease by using one of their portable adapters. When Square made their first appearance their major competitors were banks like TD and RBC who used to charge their clients ridiculous monthly fees for renting their terminals. With Square there are no monthly fees or any hidden fees or even any chargeback fees.

### The benefits of a square 
 Not only are business owners saving money but with Square you have so many benefits like Report organization: the way the information is laid out it’s  pretty straight forward. Organized report data is being collected throughout the day or the week. Customers would have access to what major business have which is data. Merchants would get to see what is their most popular product, what are their most productive days in the week or when does their store receives the most clientel traffic throughout the day. These are all important factors that you need to bring your company to the next level. 
 

### Results 

Square’s business impact compared to Paypal or Intuit is not even on the same level. Let's think about it the founder of the company Jack Dorsey is the  cofounder of Twitter.Twitter was solely designed to have people write out their thoughts and emotional meltdowns about their day, it's a virtual diary sometimes. Twitter can be used as  an announcer, a promoter or even a critic of services and products. All this information we upload to Twitter serves as Data collection. Data is what we need to create the perfect product for the right consumers. M.Dorsey even made a list called the “140 reasons why Square  will fail”. Jack Dorsey thought about all the ways that this company could have failed but he also gave 140 solutions to those problems. M.Dorsey was able to show investors like Visa and Apple that he was confident in the product and services that he would be providing to the general public. Jack Dorsey not only succeeded in bringing a well thought out product to the table, but his idea is absolutely thriving in this domain. Most of Square's publicity was done off of word of mouth because the product speaks for itself. Students uses it for fundraisers or open house mixers , well established businesses like Apple use it and small business owners use it. Square is the perfect mobile payment product. 


### Recommendations 

Square should offer an already established & small  business owner a 1 month free trial. It will allow  merchants to try the product and have a chance to see if they are able to navigate the system before making the switch to Square.It will allow them to have more exposure to the product and its functions,guaranteeing them a sale. Once the consumer sees how easy it is to set up and process payments the rest will be history. Concerning the square contactless reader they should add a built in receipt printer with it because sometimes the customer likes  to have a physical copy of their receipt not only that but it also limits the mistakes of data entries that the clerk or the customer may experience in the future due to auto correct or a typos.
